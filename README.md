- ## Approach 1: Greedy using Stack
    - ### Intuition:
        1. **Balanced Parentheses**: A valid string of parentheses must have matching pairs of `(` and `)`, with every `(` having a corresponding `)` that follows it.
        2. **Locked vs Unlocked**: Some parentheses are locked (cannot be changed), while others are unlocked (can be either `(` or `)`).
        3. **Flexible Parentheses**: The unlocked parentheses (`locked == '0'`) provide flexibility, allowing them to act as either `(` or `)` based on the needs of the string.
        4. **Stack Utilization**: We use two stacks:
            - One to track unmatched `(` parentheses.
            - Another to track unmatched `)` parentheses (for flexible positions).

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Odd Length Check**: If the length of the string is odd, it's impossible to have a balanced number of opening and closing parentheses, so we return `false` immediately.
        2. **Iterate Through the String**:
            - If a position is unlocked (`locked == '0'`), treat it as flexible and push its index onto a stack.
            - For locked parentheses:
                - If it's a `(`, push its index onto the `openingStack`.
                - If it's a `)`, try to match it with an unmatched `(` from the `openingStack` or a flexible parenthesis from `closingStack`. If no match is found, return `false`.
        3. **Final Check**: After processing the string:
            - Ensure all opening parentheses have been matched with closing parentheses.
            - If any unmatched opening parentheses remain, return `false`.

                        # If the current position is unlocked (locked == '0'), treat it as flexible
                        if locked[currentIndex] == '0': 
                            closingStack.append(currentIndex)  # Can act as either '(' or ')'

                                openingStack.pop()  # Pop the matched '(' from opening stack
                            elif closingStack:  # If it's flexible, try to match with a previous flexible parenthesis
                                closingStack.pop()  # Pop from closing stack
                            else:
                                return False  # If no unmatched '(' or flexible parenthesis available, return False
                    
                    # After processing the string, check for unmatched parentheses
                    while closingStack and openingStack:
                        # Both stacks need to match indices such that opening indices are smaller than closing indices
                        if openingStack[-1] < closingStack[-1]:  
                            closingStack.pop()  # Pop a matching closing parenthesis
                            openingStack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening parenthesis
                        else:
                            return False  # If the indices don’t match (i.e., the order is incorrect), return False

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **$O(n)$**: We iterate through the string once (to process each character) and perform stack operations (push/pop) which take constant time per operation. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the length of the string, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **$O(n)$**: The space complexity is determined by the space used to store the indices in the stacks (`openingStack` and `closingStack`). In the worst case, we may need to store all indices if none of the parentheses can be matched early, making the space complexity linear with respect to the size of the input string.
