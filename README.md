- ## Approach 2: Greedy Using Constant Space
    - ### Intuition:
        1. **Balanced Parentheses**: A valid string of parentheses must have matching pairs of `(` and `)`, with every `(` having a corresponding `)` that follows it.
        2. **Locked vs Unlocked**: Some parentheses are locked (cannot be changed), while others are unlocked (can be either `(` or `)`).
        3. **Flexible Parentheses**: The unlocked parentheses (`locked == '0'`) provide flexibility, allowing them to act as either `(` or `)` based on the needs of the string.
        4. **Two Pass Strategy**: 
            - **Forward Pass**: Ensure that the parentheses are balanced from left to right, considering unlocked positions as flexible.
            - **Backward Pass**: Ensure that the parentheses are balanced from right to left, also ensuring that flexible positions are considered correctly.

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Odd Length Check**: If the length of the string is odd, it's impossible to have a balanced number of opening and closing parentheses, so return `false` immediately.
        2. **Forward Pass (Left to Right)**:
            - Track unmatched opening and closing parentheses as you iterate through the string.
            - For locked parentheses:
                - If it’s an opening parenthesis `(`, increment the opening parenthesis counter.
                - If it’s a closing parenthesis `)`, try to match it with an unmatched opening parenthesis, or use a flexible position if necessary.
            - For unlocked positions (flexible), treat them as either `(` or `)`, adjusting counters accordingly.
        3. **Backward Pass (Right to Left)**:
            - Similarly, ensure that all parentheses are correctly matched, with flexible positions treated as either `(` or `)` based on the balance.
            - If the balance becomes positive at any point (indicating unmatched opening parentheses), return `false`.
        4. **Final Validation**:
            - After both passes, if there are any unmatched opening parentheses left, return `false`.
            - If the string has been fully balanced, return `true`.

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **$O(n)$**: 
            - We iterate through the string twice (once from left to right and once from right to left).
            - Each iteration processes each character of the string, and each stack operation (push/pop) takes constant time, so the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the length of the string, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **$O(1)$**:
            - We only use a constant amount of extra space for the counters (`openingParenthesis`, `closingParenthesis`, `currentBalance`).
            - The space used is independent of the input size, making the space complexity constant.
